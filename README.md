Title of Project: "Autoencoder Imputation of Missing Heterogeneous Data for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Classification."
The current repository consists of a deep neural network approach of imputing the missingness in the heterogenous ADNI data.
Google Colab (https://colab.google/), a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google, was utilised for conducting the study, which included data preprocessing, feature selection, missing data generation (40% - 70%, imputation using denoising autoencoder, classification using Random Forest Classifier and validations.

Dataset:
The dataset used in the study was obtained from ADNIMERGE-3 open repository as per request.
